                  equality treatment in higher-order (HO) automated
                  theorem proving: a calculus $\EXTPARA$ adapting
                  traditional first-order (FO)
                  paramodulation~\cite{RoWo69} , and a calculus
                  $\EXTRUE$ adapting FO
                  RUE-Resolution~\cite{Digricoli79} to HO logic (based
                  on Church's simply typed
                  $\lambda$-calculus). $\EXTPARA$ and $\EXTRUE$ extend
                  the extensional HO resolution approach
                  $\EXTRES$~\cite{BenKoh:ehor98}. In order to reach
                  Henkin completeness without the need for additional
                  extensionality axioms both calculi employ new,
                  positive extensionality rules analogously to the
                  respective negative ones provided by $\EXTRES$ that
                  operate on unification constraints. As the
                  extensionality rules have an intrinsic and
                  unavoidable difference-reducing character the HO
                  paramodulation approach looses its pure
                  term-rewriting character. On the other hand examples
                  demonstrate that the extensionality rules harmonise
                  rather well with the difference-reducing HO
                  RUE-resolution idea.",

                  the LEO-System shows. Furthermore, we prove the

                  restrict the order of primitive substitutions to the
                  order of input formulae.}

                  equality treatment in higher-order (HO) automated
                  theorem proving: a calculus $\EXTPARA$ adapting
                  traditional first-order (FO)
                  paramodulation~\cite{RoWo69} , and a calculus
                  $\EXTRUE$ adapting FO
                  RUE-Resolution~\cite{Digricoli79} to HO logic (based
                  on Church's simply typed
                  $\lambda$-calculus). $\EXTPARA$ and $\EXTRUE$ extend
                  the extensional HO resolution approach
                  $\EXTRES$~\cite{BenKoh:ehor98}. In order to reach
                  Henkin completeness without the need for additional
                  extensionality axioms both calculi employ new,
                  positive extensionality rules analogously to the
                  respective negative ones provided by $\EXTRES$ that
                  operate on unification constraints. As the
                  extensionality rules have an intrinsic and
                  unavoidable difference-reducing character the HO
                  paramodulation approach looses its pure
                  term-rewriting character. On the other hand examples
                  demonstrate that the extensionality rules harmonise
                  rather well with the difference-reducing HO
                  RUE-resolution idea.},

  abstract =	 {This paper reports on the integration of the
                  higher-order theorem proving environment TPS
                  [Andrews96] into the mathematical assistant OMEGA
                  [Omega97]. TPS can be called from OMEGA either as a
                  black box or as an interactive system. In black box
                  mode, the user has control over the parameters which
                  control proof search in TPS; in interactive mode,
                  all features of the TPS-system are available to the
                  user. If the subproblem which is passed to TPS
                  contains concepts defined in OMEGA's database of
                  mathematical theories, these definitions are not
                  instantiated but are also passed to TPS. Using a
                  special theory which contains proof tactics that
                  model the ND-calculus variant of TPS within OMEGA,
                  any complete or partial proof generated in TPS can
                  be translated one to one into an OMEGA proof
                  plan. Proof transformation is realised by proof plan
                  expansion in OMEGA's 3-dimensional proof data
                  structure, and remains transparent to the user.},

                  based automated theorem proving in classical
                  higher-order logic (based on Church's simply typed
                  lambda calculus) and discuss their requirements with
                  respect to Henkin completeness and full
                  extensionality. In particular we focus on Andrews'
                  higher-order resolution [Andrews71], Huet's
                  constrained resolution [Huet72], higher-order
                  $E$-resolution, and extensional higher-order
                  resolution [BenzmuellerKohlhase98]. With the help of
                  examples we illustrate the parallels and differences
                  of the extensionality treatment of these approaches
                  and demonstrate that extensional higher-order
                  resolution is the sole approach that can completely
                  avoid additional extensionality axioms.},

                  on top of an agent-based command suggestion
                  mechanism. The theorem prover inherits beneficial
                  properties from the underlying suggestion mechanism
                  such as run-time extendibility and resource
                  adaptability. Moreover, it supports the distributed
                  integration of external reasoning systems. We also
                  discuss how the implementation and modeling of a
                  calculus in our agent-based approach can be
                  investigated wrt. the inheritance of properties such
                  as completeness and soundness.},
