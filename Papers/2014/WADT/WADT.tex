% \section{Introduction}
%

Logic embeddings provide an elegant means to formalize sophisticated
non-classical logics in classical higher-order logic (HOL, Church's
simple type theory \cite{Church40}). In previous work (cf.~\cite{C35}
and the references therein) the embeddings approach has been
successfully applied to automate object-level and meta-level reasoning
for a range of logics and logic combinations with off-the-shelf HOL
theorem provers. This also includes quantified modal logics (QML)
\cite{J23} and quantified conditional logics (QCL) \cite{C37}.  For
many of the embedded logics few or none automated theorem provers did
exist before. HOL is exploited in this approach to encode the
semantics of the logics to be embedded, for example, Kripke semantics
for QMLs \cite{fitting98} or selection function semantics for QCLs
\cite{Stalnaker68}.  The embeddings approach is related to labelled
deductive systems \cite{gabbay96}, which employ meta-level
(world-)labeling techniques for the modeling and implementation of
non-classical proof systems. In our embeddings approach such labels
are instead encoded in the HOL logic.

In recent work \cite{C40,J28} we have applied the embeddings
approach to verify and automate a philosophical argument that has
fascinated philosophers and theologists for about 1000 years: the
ontological argument for the existence of
God~\cite{sobel2004logic}. We have thereby concentrated on
G\"odel's \cite{GoedelNotes}, respectively  Scott's \cite{ScottNotes},
modern
version of this argument, which employs a second-order modal logic, for
which, until now, no theorem provers were available.  In our
computer-assisted study of the argument, the HOL provers LEO-II
\cite{C26} and Satallax \cite{Satallax} have made some interesting
observations, some of which were unknown so far.

Ongoing and future work concentrates on the systematic study of
G\"odel's and Scott's proofs. We have also begun to study more recent
variants of the argument
\cite{anderson90:_some_emend_of_goedel_ontol_proof,AndersonGettings,bjordal99,fuhrmann05:_exist_notwen,fitting02:_types_tableaus_god,Hajek2002,Hajek2008},
which claim to remedy some fundamental problem of G\"odel's and Scott's proofs, known as the modal collapse. The long-term goal
is to work out a  landscape of the detailled logic parameters (e.g., constant
vs. varying domains, rigid vs. non-rigid terms, logics KB vs.
S4 vs.  S5, etc.) under which the proposed variants of the 
modern ontological argument hold or fail.

There is little related work~\cite{oppenheimera11,rushby13}, and this focuses solely on the comparably simpler,
original ontological argument by Anselm of Canterbury.  % These works do not achieve the close
% correspondence between the original formulations and the formal
% encodings that can be found in our approach and they do also not reach
% the same of degree of proof automation.

Our work attests the maturity of contemporary interactive and
automated deduction tools for HOL and
demonstrates the elegance and practical relevance of the
embeddings-based approach. Most importantly, our work opens new
perspectives towards a computational metaphysics.
