\begin{abstract}
The \emph{modal collapse} that afflicts G\"odel's modal ontological 
argument for God's existence is discussed from the perspective of the 
modal square of opposition. Furthermore, a computer-assisted verification 
of the claims that the emendations by Anderson and by Frode are immune to 
the modal collapse is presented.

\section{Introduction}

Attempts to prove the
existence (or non-existence) of God by means of abstract, ontological
arguments are an old tradition in western philosophy, with contributions by several prominent philosophers, including St. Anselm of
Canterbury, Descartes and Leibniz. Kurt G{\"o}del studied and further improved this argument, bringing it to a mathematically more precise form, as a chain of axioms, lemmas and theorems in a modal logic \cite{GoedelNotes,ScottNotes}, as in Fig. \ref{fig:scott}.

% Ontological arguments, for or against the existence of God,
% illustrate well an essential aspect of metaphysics: some (necessary) facts
% for our existing world are deduced by purely a priori, analytical means from some
% abstract definitions and axioms. % Contingent truths are to be
% distinguished from necessary truths.


G\"{o}del defines God (see Fig.~\ref{fig1}) as a being who possesses all \emph{positive}
properties.  He does not extensively discuss what positive properties
are, but instead he states a few reasonable (but debatable) axioms
that they should satisfy.  
The overall idea of G{\"o}del's proof is in the tradition of Anselm's
argument, who defined God as some entity of which nothing greater can be
conceived. Anselm argued that existence in the actual world would
make such an assumed being even greater; hence, by definition God must
exist. G{\"o}del's ontological argument is clearly related to this
reasoning pattern. However, it also tries to fix some fundamental
weaknesses in Anselm's work. For example, G{\"o}del explicitly proves
that God's existence is possible, which has been a basic assumption for
Anselm. Because of this, Anselm's argument has been
criticized as incomplete by Leibniz. Leibniz claimed that the
assumption should be derivable from the definition of God as a perfect
being and from the notion of perfection.  G{\"o}del's proof 
addresses this critique, and it also addresses Kant's objection that existence should not be treated as a predicate. 

Nevertheless, G{\"o}del's work
still leaves room for criticism. In particular, his axioms are so
strong that they entail a \emph{modal collapse} 
\cite{ToDo:sobel1987?,sobel2004logic}: 
everything that is the case is so necessarily. 
There has been an impressive body of recent and ongoing
work (cf.~\cite{sobel2004logic,Fitting,anderson90:_some_emend_of_goedel_ontol_proof,AndersonGettings,ToDo:FrodeAndHajek,ContemporaryBibliography} and the references therein)
proposing solutions for the modal collapse. 
The goal of this paper is to present a computer-assisted analysis of 
the solutions proposed by Anderson and by Frode. The technique enabling this analysis is the embedding of quantified modal logics into higher-order logics \cite{J23,B9,C36}, for which automated theorem provers exist \cite{ToDo:leo,sattalax,isabelle,coq}. This technique has already been succesfully employed in the verification and reconstruction of G\"odel's proof \cite{todo:all our previous papers}, and a detailed mathematical description of the technique is available in \cite{todo:ECAI}.

\section{Conclusions}


Various slightly different versions of
axioms and definitions have been considered by G\"{o}del and by
several philosophers who commented on his proof
(cf.~\cite{sobel2004logic,anderson90:_some_emend_of_goedel_ontol_proof,AndersonGettings,Fitting,Adams,ContemporaryBibliography}).



In theoretical philosophy, formal logical confrontations with such
ontological arguments had been so far (mainly) limited to paper
and pen.  Up to now, the use of computers was prevented, because the
logics of the available theorem proving systems were not expressive
enough to formalize the abstract concepts adequately. G{\"o}del's proof
uses, for example, a complex higher-order modal logic (\HOML) to handle
concepts such as \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} and to support
quantification over individuals and properties.

% \begin{defn}
% This serves as environment for definitions. Note that the text
% appears not in italics.
% \end{defn}

% \begin{equation}\label{testequation}
% \text{This is a sample equation: } c^2=a^2+b^2
% \end{equation}

% \begin{thm}[Main Theorem]
% In contrast to definitions, theorems appear typeset in italics as
% it has become more or less standard in most textbooks and
% monographs. Equations can be cited using the \verb+\eqref+ command which
% automatically adds brackets: \verb+\eqref{testequation}+ results in \eqref{testequation}.
% \end{thm}

% \begin{proof}
% A special environment is predefined: the \textit{proof} environment. Please use
% \begin{verbatim}\begin{proof}\end{verbatim}
% proof of the statement
% \begin{verbatim}\end{proof}\end{verbatim}
% for typesetting your proofs. The end-of-proof symbol $\Box$ will be added automatically.
% \end{proof}

% There are two known problems with the placement of the end-of-proof sign:

% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item if your proof ends with a\ \ s i n g l e\ \ displayed line, the end-of-proof sign would
% be placed in the line below; if you want to avoid this, write your line in the form
% \begin{verbatim}$$displayed math line \eqno\qedhere$$\end{verbatim}
% which results in

% \begin{proof}
% $$displayed math line \eqno\qedhere$$
% \end{proof}
% \item if your proof ends with an aligned displayed environment, the command
% \verb+\tag*{\qed}+ can be used to place the end-of-proof sign properly:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{align*}
% \alpha&=\beta+\gamma\\
% &=\delta+\epsilon\tag*{\qed}
% \end{align*}
% \end{verbatim}
% results in
% \begin{align*}
% \alpha&=\beta+\gamma\\
% &=\delta+\epsilon\tag*{\qed}
% \end{align*}
% \end{enumerate}
% Please try to avoid using the obsolete \verb+\eqnarray+ environment. This environment has several bugs
% and has been replaced by the more flexible \AmS\ environments \verb+align, split, multline+.


% \begin{rem}
% Additional comments are being typeset without boldfaced entrance
% word as they may be minor important.
% \end{rem}

% \begin{ex}
% For some constructs, even no number is required.
% \end{ex}

% Displayed equations may be numbered like the following one:
% \begin{equation}
% \sqrt{1-\sin^2(x)}=|\cos(x)|.
